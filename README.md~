Summary
-------

The simulation function in this repository allows simulation of phylogeny and sequence alignment under different rates of diversifcation and rates of molecular substitution. Specifically, it allows varaition in the rate of speciation and the rate of susbstitution, which can have a tendendcy to increase or decrease through time. The function also allows these rates to have a direct positive association, and allows the user to set a constant background rate of extinction.

Example of usage
----------------

As any standard funciton in R, the parameters desired in the function tr.mu.sp are given as arguments.
